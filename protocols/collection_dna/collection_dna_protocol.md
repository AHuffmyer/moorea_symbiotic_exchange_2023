# Coral collection and DNA sampling protocol
 
Collection and DNA sampling protocol for Moorea 2023 project 

Author: Ariana S Huffmyer    

# Overview 

This protocol details sample collection, photographing, and collection of samples for DNA for species identification for Acropora and Pocillopora samples during Moorea Fall 2023 expedition.

# 1. Field collection 

Print out field data collection sheet [available here](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023/blob/main/data/field_collection/field_collection_datasheet.xlsx).  

We will collect ACR and POC adults and recruits in the field for three phases of the experiment: initial PI curves, P & R rates, and stable isotope incubations. 

Replication information is detailed on the [project design document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15cdHZ-Q86GD9XM0eCkfVNGKb1StGpJ9q/view). 

Pre-labl whirl packs with codes for the species - lifestage - number. For example: 

- Acropora adults: ACR-A-1
- Acropora recruits: ACR-R-1
- Pocillopora adults: POC-A-1
- Pocillopora recruits: POC-R-1

Adults will be sampled by clipping fragments (<5 cm) off of branches of adult colonies. 

Recruits will be sampled by using clippers, hammer/chisel, and/or a knife to remove the recruit/juvenile from the substrate. Substrate can be taken off later in the lab if necessary. We will collect recruits/juveniles as less than 5 cm diameter across a range of sizes. 

Before sampling, take an image of the coral to be sampled with the labeled whirl pack and a ruler with color scale. 

After taking a photo, remove the coral, place it in a whirl pack filled with water and loosely closed. THe coral should stay in the bag, but allow for some water exchange. 

Whirl packs of samples can then be placed in coolers on the boat for transport back to the lab. 

It will be best to have 2-3 people. One person can hold the whirl pack and ruler while the other takes a photo. That person can then take a sample and the other person hold the samples in a mesh bag. 

# 2. Attaching corals to plugs, take images, and sample DNA 

After bringing samples back to the lab, place the samples in a water table in their open whirl pack. Allow for plenty of water flow. 

Each sample can then be trimmed to remove substrate. Glue each sample to an aragonite frag plug. 

Take a small sample (~0.5 cm biopsy) of each sample and place into a tube labeled with the ID number and "DNA" and the date with 700 uL of RNA/DNA shield. Clean the clippers used with bleach, ethanol, and DI water between samples. Wear gloves. 

Record sample metadata on GitHub. 

Attach/wrap a piece of plastic tape or waterproof label with the coral identification number from the whirl pack. 

Once attached, take another image with a ruler and color scale. 

Save these whirl packs to be used for sampling later on. 

Place the corals on plugs on a rack and allow to recover at ambient temperature and ambient light (<500 PAR) for 1-2 days prior to sampling. 

Upload images and data sheets to GitHub.
