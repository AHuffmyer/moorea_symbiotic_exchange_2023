<a name="Initial"></a>**Initial Setup**

Setting up the respirometry system for the first time in a new place:

1. Suspend AI lights above each bin, following the [(AI Light Protocol)](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-03-18-AI-Lights.md) for set up instructions.
2. To control the AI light settings:
	* Download the myAI® app on a compatible iOS or Android phone. 
        * Follow the [(AI Lights Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-03-18-AI-Lights.md) for setup and useage instructions. 
3. Place respirometry chambers into the water bins, each sitting on a magnetic stir plate.  
4. Using the apogee quantum meter to measure light levels at each position, adjust the placement of the bin, stand, and AI lights as necessary to attain desired light intensities. Ideally, light levels should be as equal as possible across the different positions on the 2 stands. 
5. Record the AI light settings and position combinations required to obtain each desired light intensity required for the PI curves.

    **In Mo'orea, E5 March, September, and November 2020 timepoints desired light intensities and percentages recorded below**

<a name="Bath"></a> **Water Bath Setup**

1. Fill the bins with source water, enough to just fully submerge the chambers once the chambers are placed inside.
2. Measure and record the temperature and salinity of the source water (i.e., in the water table where the coral are kept). 
3. Place an aquarium pump and a heater into each bin. **The pump(s) and heater(s) must be fully submerged before powering on.** Plug in each piece of equipment, making sure the outlets have an appropriate voltage. Adjust the temperature of the bins so that they approximate the water temperature experienced by the coral being measured. Use the Apex system if desired.  
4. While you wait for the bath and source water to reach the desired temperature, set up the respirometer and prepare the chambers.  

<a name="Chambers"></a> **Filling and Securing Chambers**

1. Fill the chambers with temperature controlled water, add the plug stand and stir bars, and add corals to each chamber. Seal the top.  
	* Leave one chamber per bin filled with only water and no coral. This will serve as the blank. There will be two blanks per run. 
3. Record the identify of the coral fragment or the blank with its corresponding chamber number.   
5. When you are ready to place the chambers in the stand, use your thumb to cover the holes (for the temperature and oxygen probes) that are in the top of the chamber. Move and gently place the chambers in a random position in the stand. Record the position of each chamber.
6. Start the stirring.     

<a name="Probes"></a> **Inserting Oxy-10 Probes**

1. All of the temperature probes and oxygen probes are numbered. The probe numbers should match the number of the chamber, **not** the position number.
2. Careful to not damage the probes or introduce bubbles to the chamber, insert the temperature probe into the larger probe port and gently guide it down until it fits snuggly and securely. Approximately half of the probe should be in the chamber without it touching the coral.  
3. Gently guide the oxygen probe into its port, being careful to not scratch the probe tip. The probe tip should be at least 2 cm into the chamber, but can be inserted farther, as long as the probe isn't touching any organisms or objects in the chamber. **Note** The oxygen probe may need to be inserted deeping into the chamber so that its cord is not touching the Ocean Revive lights. The oxygen probes use fiberoptic cables that can melt and be damaged by the heat of the lights. **Double check that the oxygen probe cables are never touching the light cables.**
4. Check for bubbles inside the chambers.  If any bubbles are present, try to remove them.  
	* You may be able to guide small bubbles out of the airlock seal on the chamber lid.  
	* For large bubbles or a large quantity of bubbles, remove the chamber, place back into the source water, unscrew the bottom to wipe or shake away any bubbles, then close and re-secure the chamber.

<a name="Presens"></a> **Enter Sample IDs into PreSens**

1. In the PreSens program, navigate to the "Measurements" tab
2. Click "New" and enter in a sample ID name. Sample names should include the species ID name (or blank), number, and date. 
	* Example name for coral: ACR-254_20200105
	* Example name for blank: BK-4_20200105
3. 	After entering the sample name, click the name of the sample and click the corresponding channel you wish to assign it to. Click the "Assign to" button to assign the channel to the sample. **Each sample should only be assigned to 1 channel!**

<a name="Final_Checks"></a> **Final Checks**

Last checks before starting to record data using the PreSens program:  

1. Stir bars should be spinning in place and at normal speed (If not, the battery needs to be switched out and recharged - see [**Take-Down**](#Take-Down) instructions for proper procedures)  
2. Chambers are securely fastened on the respirometer stand  
3. No bubbles are present inside the chambers  
4. The correct probes are in the correct chambers (Every numbered temperature probe is with its corresponding oxygen probe and in the chamber you've assigned to the probe pair)  


<a name="Data"></a> **Collecting the Data**

1.  The first light level is 0. Turn off the lights in the room during this measurement.
2. Navigate to the "Live View" tab.
3. Select Channel 1 in the PreSens software. Click "Start." Continue through each channel, starting the data collection. Each channel must be started individually. Verify that all channels have been started. Record the start time. 
4. After 10 minutes, click "Stop" for each channel. Record the stop time. 
5. Adjust the light settings to the desired intensity. 
6. Restart the data collection only after 2 or more minutes has passed since stopping the previous measurement.
	* **Helpful tip**: Approximately 20-30 minutes before the end of the respirometry run (i.e., during the 8th light intensity level) begin preparing the next set of samples. 

7. **As soon as the data for the final light intensity has been collected, export and save the data.** To export the data
	* Navigate to the "Measurements" tab
	* Highlight all of the samples from the current respiration run
	* Click "Export"
	* For each sample, select the target by clicking "Browse"
	* Navigate to where you would like to save the file
	* Change the file type to a .csv and click "Save"
	* Each sample must be individually directed to the target location and saved as a .csv
	* Click "Export"
	* Once the export has finished, save all files to the Google Drive

<a name="Removing"></a> **Removing Chambers from Respirometer**

1. Remove the probes and carefully place or drape them in a secure location.  
2. Unscrew the holding plates and remove a chamber.  
3. Unscrew the airlock seal on the lid (best method for pouring the water into another container) and pour the water into the graduated cylinder. Record the volume. 
4. Remove the coral sample from the plug and place in a labeled whirl pack. Freeze in liquid nitrogen and place in the -40C freezer.   

<a name="Take-Down"></a> **Respirometer Take-Down and CleanUp**

1. Using a isopropanol wipe, wipe down the cord of each Oxy-10 probe to remove any remaining salt deposits or particulates, then recoil the probes and store them in a secure place.   
2. Rinse all chambers and stir bars with fresh water and let them dry overnight.  
3. Empty the seawater from the respirometry bins
4. Take down, wipe the cables with isopropanol wipes, and securely store the AI lights
