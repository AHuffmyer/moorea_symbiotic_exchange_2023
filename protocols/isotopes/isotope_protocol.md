# Stable Isotope Incubation Protocol   
 
Stable isotope incubation protocol for Moorea 2023 project 

Author: Ariana S Huffmyer   

Modified from previous Hawaii larval isotope protocols 

# Overview 

The purpose of this experiment is to track symbiotic nutritional exchange and photosynthate metabolism across species and lifestage in Moorea, French Polynesia. Stable isotope metabolomics will be used here to detect the presence of symbiont-derived carbon (C13 bicarbonate) in intermediate metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism (Matthews et al. 2018, Hillyer et al. 2017, Hillyer et al. 2018). 

# Supplies 

Incubation supplies: 

- Temperature controlled bins with stir plates and stir bars (including heaters and Apex units)
- Incubation chambers (glass 4 oz jars) 
- Aquarium lighting (AI 32 HD x 3)
- Bucket, beakers, pipettes (separate labeled and non-labeled C set)
- Filtered seawater (0.2 µm)
- Whirl packs
- Liquid nitrogen
- Mesh cell strainers 
- Bone cutters/clippers
- 3 small temperature loggers (pendant or tidbit)
- PVC light rig 
- 2 waste buckets 
- Squirt bottle with FSW 
- Black/electrical tape (n=3 jars with tape) 

Isotope solution preparation: 

- 12C sodium bicarbonate (regular sodium bicarbonate)
- 13C bicarbonate
- NaOH solution (1 M)
- Filtered seawater (0.2µm)
- pH probe
- Ethanol
- DI or MQ water
- 1 L nalgene jars with one set (2-3 bottles) for C13 labeled and one set for C12 unlabeled (1 bottle)

# Testing 

Prior to running these incubations, we need to run the following tests: 

- Run with FSW sealed for 4 h to monitor health of the corals and ensure the sealed jar for 4 h does not result in mortality. 
- Test open vs closed jars. 

# Prepare solutions 

On the day of the incubations, make the fresh solutions. 

### NaOH solution CHECK THIS WITH PUBS 

To make the 1 M NaOH solution to balance the pH of the isotope solutions, mix the following. 

- 2 g NaOH pellets
- 50 mL MQ or DI water 

Slowly add the pellets to the water, not the other way around! Mix carefully and perform the mixing under the hood. 

Once mixed, this solution can be used to balance pH of C13 and C12 solutions during the experiment. 

### C13 bicarbonate solution 

We will make solutions fresh each day prior to incubations. This recipe will make enough C13 solution for 39 samples (36 samples and 3 dark controls). The samples will be in 4 oz jars (~119 mL each). 

To make a 4 mM solution of C13 bicarbonate, mix the following each day. 

- 4760 mL of FSW 
- 1.6184 g of C13 sodium bicarbonate 

If making this in smaller batches (5 batches to fit in 1 L containers), mix the following: 

- 952 mL of FSW 
- 0.3237 g of C13 sodium bicarbonate

Finally, add (one drop at a time) the NaOH solution until a pH of 8.0 is reached. The solution is now ready to use. 

### C12 bicarbonate solution 

We will make solutions fresh each day prior to incubations. This recipe will make enough C12 solution for 3 samples (3 C12 controls). The samples will be in 4 oz jars (~119 mL each). 

To make a 4 mM solution of C13 bicarbonate, mix the following each day. 

- 357 mL of FSW 
- 0.120 g of C12 sodium bicarbonate 

Finally, add (one drop at a time) the NaOH solution until a pH matching that of the natural seawater is reached. The solution is now ready to use.


# Set up coral samples and temperature treatments 

### Coral samples 

Prepare the appropriate number of coral samples (that have previously been secured to plugs, photographed, sampled, and identified). 

Prior to incubations, allow corals to sit in a tub at ambient temperature (27°C) for about 30 minutes to dark adapt. 

Sample metadata [can be found on GitHub here](). 

Run metadata and plate maps [can be found on GitHub here](). 

Next, load samples individually into jars by placing the coral on the plug stand, filling the jar with the appropriate solution, and securing the coral in the jar. The jar can then be submerged on the stir plate with stirring. 

It is very important to load the samples with C12 solutions first to prevent C13 contamination. 

Dark samples should have jars wrapped in black tape or other covering to prevent any light from entering the jar. 

### Temperatures

Temperature will be controlled in each bin using a titanium heater and Apex equipment. Prior to incbuations, set the Apex equipment and heaters with the bins such that one bin is controlled at ambient/27°C, 30°C and 33°C. One jar per bin will have a temperature logger for tracking temperature treatments. 

# Start incubations

Once all samples are loaded, record the time the samples are added into the bin. Since the loading will be staggered, we will also sample the corals in a staggered fashion. Load across temperatures randomly. 

Lights should be placed so that light intensity is as even as possible across the samples and at an average intensity of Ik determined from previous PI curves. 

Light intensity for this experiment will be set at XXX. Lights will be secured above bin using a PVC rig. 

# Run incubations

Incubations will be run for 4 hours. Each hour, randomly rotate the samples within each bin. Manually monitor the temperature to ensure the temperature treatments are running as intended. 

*Discussion point: Should we leave jars open or closed?* 

# End incubations and sample corals   

At 4.5 hours, we will now sample corals. The loading will be staggered such that the sampling will also be staggered. The C12 samples will be loaded first, so those will be sampled first, and so on. Change gloves between isotope types (e.g., C12, C13, and dark). 

To sample, remove the jar from the bin. Empty the water into a bucket labeled for the appropriate isotope type. This water will be disposed of as specified by Gump. 

Next, rinse the coral sample gently using FSW. Remove the coral from the plug and place into a labeled whirl pack. Submerge in liquid nitrogen and store at -40°C.
